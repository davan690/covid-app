## About the app
The web client uses React. The backend uses Express. For now the backend does nothing, but can be used to compute and transmit more complex data. Right now there is just a connection saying "API is working properly" to show the connection.

## How to run the API
Note: Not needed right now, so you can skip this step.
1. In your terminal, navigate to the `api` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app.

## How to run the Client
1. In another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
